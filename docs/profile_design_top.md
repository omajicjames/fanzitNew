Profile top: modern, original, and on-brand

1) Banner → Duotone “depth” gradient (not IG’s rainbow).
Use a low-contrast duotone with a subtle vertical glow and a soft vignette at the bottom so the name block pops. Add a faint animated light sweep on hover/scroll for “alive, not loud.”

2) Avatar → layered medallion, micro-prestige.
Keep the overlap, but frame the avatar with a 2-ring stack: inner neutral ring, 1px brand-gold hairline outside it. A tiny drop shadow (y-2, blur-4) adds depth without skeuomorphism.

3) Name block → hierarchy and breathing room.

Creator name on one line, bold, slightly larger than IG (e.g., 22–24 px).

Handle below in muted tone.

Verified: tiny “crown-tick” (blue tick + gold crown accent) tucked to the right of the name, not screaming.

4) Stats → compact chips, not big counters.
Swap the bulky stat rows for small pill chips: 342 Posts · 12.5K Followers · 89.2K Following. Light separators (·) and muted color keep it elegant.

5) Action row → one primary, the rest quiet.

Primary = Follow/Subscribe full-width on mobile, medium size on desktop; solid blue.

Secondary = Message / Share as ghost buttons (outline/quiet).

Keep spacing tight so the row reads as one control cluster.

6) Bio → two-line clamp + “More” micro-interaction.
Show two lines by default with a “More” affordance that expands inline. On expand, reveal link(s) + emojis + a tiny location pin. Smooth height animation keeps it delightful. (You already have a collapsible bio pattern — lean into it.)

7) Utility row → small iconography, left-aligned.
Website, location, joined date as tiny icon-label pairs under the bio. Don’t box them; keep them text-level for a newsroom vibe.

8) Tabs → segmented, sticky, and understated.
A segmented control (Posts · About · Subscriptions · Reviews) that becomes sticky after 1 scroll. Active segment uses a 2px top stroke + subtle glow; no heavy bars.

9) Scroll behavior → “shrink & pin” mini-header.
After the hero scrolls off, morph into a mini header docked to the top: avatar (16–20px), name, primary CTA. This keeps conversion visible without being pushy.

10) Motion language → fast, frictionless, invisible.
150–200ms, ease-in-out. Animate opacity/transform only. No bounce. Keep it “butter, not bubble gum.”

Concrete spec (so it’s buildable)

Spacing: 16px base, 24px between hero blocks, 8px inside chips.

Type: 24/18/14 (name/handle/meta), semi-bold name, regular elsewhere.

Color discipline: content on zinc neutrals; blue only for primary CTAs/active states; gold for tiny prestige accents (verified ring hairline, tiny icon fills).

States: hover on buttons = +4% luminance; focus rings = 2px primary; reduced-motion honors OS setting.

Edge cases: long names truncate after 1 line; no banner falls back to a soft radial behind the avatar; RTL flips icon padding accordingly.

How this distinguishes you from Instagram

Editorial, not glossy. Duotone + vignette = modern product feel over entertainment “pop.”

Prestige in micro-details. Gold is whispered in the avatar ring and verified accent, not splashed.

Conversion-aware UX. Sticky mini-header keeps Follow/Subscribe present without hawking it.

You’ve already laid the groundwork for the banner overlap and collapsible bio in your current profile component; this build keeps that and tightens the visual system so it reads premium and original, not derivative.
