The Admin Analytics Dashboard
• Purpose: To monitor the health, growth, and trends of the entire platform.
• User: Employees of the platform company (e.g., analysts, managers, execs).
• Data Scope: Aggregated, platform-wide data. It can drill down into individual
creator data only for support or compliance reasons and with appropriate
permissions.
• Location: A separate internal admin panel or portal, with secure login, not
accessible to regular users.
• Content: The "For Platform Admins" sections we discussed. It's focused on top-level
metrics, trends, and cohort analysis across all users.
Overview (The Admin’s Dashboard)
Platform-Wide Health Metrics:
• Total Platform Revenue & Take Rate
• Daily Active Creators / Fans
• New Sign-ups (Creators vs. Fans)
• Top Earners List (to identify and support key creators)
Cohorts (Understanding Audience Value)
• Creator Cohorts: Analyze the performance of creators who joined in a given month.
How many are still active? How many hit revenue milestones?
• Fan Cohorts: Analyze the spending behavior and retention of fans who sign up in a
given month.
Funnels (Optimizing the User Journey)
• Fan Sign-up & Onboarding Funnel: Where do potential fans abandon the
registration process?
• Creator Application Funnel: Tracking the journey from applicant to verified, active
creator.
• Overall Monetization Funnel: Site Visit -> Sign Up -> First Subscription -> First
Tip/PPV Purchase.
Retention (The Core Business Metric)
• Platform-Wide Fan Retention: Are fans staying on the platform and spending
money month-over-month?
• Creator Retention: Are new creators staying active, or are they churning after the
first month due to lack of earnings? This is crucial for platform growth.
