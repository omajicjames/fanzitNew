design a comprehensive Integrations Management section for your admin dashboard.
Let's break down where everything belongs and what information each card should
contain.
1. The Big Picture: Understanding the Structure
Your subtabs.png file defines the main structure for this part of the admin panel:
• Integrations: This is the main landing page. It shows all connected services (like the
cards in cardComponents.png) with their status and key metrics.
• Catalog: This would be a list of available integrations that an admin can browse and
install, like an "app store" for your platform.
• Webhooks: This is a technical view for managing webhook endpoints and logs for
each integration (e.g., seeing if Stripe sent a payment_intent.succeeded event).
• API Keys: This is where you manage the API keys your platform uses to connect to
these third-party services (e.g., viewing, rotating your Stripe Secret Key).
The cardComponents.png shows individual cards that belong on the Integrations subtab.
2. Integration Cards: What Should Be on Each One
The goal of each card is to provide an at-a-glance status and quick access to the most
important actions and information for that service. They should not contain every possible
detail.
Here is a breakdown of what each card from your list should contain and why:
A. Payment Providers (CCBill, Segpay, etc.)
These are the most critical. The card needs to show financial health and require action.
Card Title: CCBill / Segpay / NOWPayments Status: Active / Error / Pending Key
Information:
• Mode: Live / Test (Crucial to avoid processing test payments in production)
• Balance: Pending Payout: $X,XXX (The amount of money processed but not yet sent
to your bank)
• Today's Volume: # Transactions / $ Amount
• Requires Action: # Failed Payouts / # Disputes
• Last Sync: [Timestamp] (When your platform last synced data from them)
Actions:
• View Dashboard (Links to your internal dashboard for this provider, with detailed
transactions)
• Configure (Opens settings to update API keys, set payout schedules, etc.)
• Sync Now (Manually trigger a sync with the provider's API)
Why? This gives the admin an instant view of cash flow and immediate problems without
needing to log in to each provider's separate portal.
B. Email Service (SendGrid)
Card Title: SendGrid Email Service Status: Active / Error / Pending Key Information:
• Credits Used (This Month): 12,400 / 100,000
• Delivery Rate: 99.2%
• Last Error: [Error Message from API] (e.g., "Invalid API Key" - This is VITAL if status is
Error)
• Last Sent: [Timestamp] (When the last email was sent via this service)
Actions:
• View Logs (See recent sent emails, opens, clicks, bounces)
• Configure (Update API key, default from address)
Why? Email is critical for user onboarding, notifications, and security. The admin needs to
know it's functional and not running out of credits, and see immediately why it's broken if it
fails.
C. Storage Service (AWS S3)
Card Title: AWS S3 Storage Status: Active / Error / Pending Key Information:
• Storage Used: 245 GB / 1 TB
• This Month's Cost: $12.30 (Estimated from API)
• Bandwidth This Month: 512 GB
• Public URL: https://[your-bucket].s3.amazonaws.com (Quick copy button)
Actions:
• Configure (Update Bucket Name, Region, or Keys)
• Browse Files (A link to a simple internal file browser, not the AWS console)
Why? To monitor costs and capacity. Running out of storage would break the site (users
couldn't upload content), and unexpected cost spikes hurt the budget.
D. Analytics Service (Google Analytics)
Card Title: Google Analytics Status: Active / Error / Pending Key Information:
• Property: UA-XXXXXX-X / G-XXXXXX (Which GA property is linked)
• Users (Last 7d): 15.2K
• Top Page: /creator/username
• Data Stream: Healthy / Error
Actions:
• View Report (Links to the actual GA dashboard)
• Configure (Re-authenticate OAuth, change linked property)
Why? Confirms data is flowing to the correct property and provides a tiny glimpse of
platform health. The "View Report" action acknowledges that deep analysis happens in GA
itself.
E. Other Integrations (Discord Bot, HubSpot CRM)
Card Title: Discord Bot Integration / HubSpot CRM Status: Active / Error / Pending Key
Information:
• HubSpot: # of Contacts Synced, Last Synced Time.
• Discord: Server Name, # of Messages Sent, Channel Linked.
• For "Error" or "Pending": Clear message like "Pending OAuth Completion" or
"Invalid Webhook URL".
Actions:
• Configure (Complete setup, re-authenticate)
• View [Settings] (e.g., "View Mappings" for HubSpot, "View Channel" for Discord)
Why? Provides context for what the integration is connected to and a basic health check.
3. How This Fits Together: A Practical Example
An admin logs in and goes to Integrations > Integrations. They see a grid of cards.
1. 2. They immediately see SendGrid has an "Error" status. The card shows "Last Error:
API Key Rejected". They click Configure, paste a new API key, and save. The status
goes back to "Active".
They see the CCBill card shows "Requires Action: 3 Failed Payouts". They click
View Dashboard to be taken to an internal list of failed payouts to see which
creators are affected and contact them to update their banking info.
This interface prevents the admin from needing to log into 5+ different external services
daily just to check if everything is running smoothly. It centralizes operational awareness.
