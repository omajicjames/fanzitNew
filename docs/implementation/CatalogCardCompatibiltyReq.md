Here are the key categories of information that should pop up, designed to work for any
integration (Payment, Analytics, Storage, etc.):
1. Technical Requirements & Compatibility (Critical for
Installation)
This is the most important section. It tells an admin if they can even install this.
• API Credentials Needed: "Requires: PayPal Client ID, Secret Key, Webhook Signing
Secret" (This tells them what to get from the other service before starting setup).
• Platform Compatibility: "Compatible with: Node.js 18+, Python 3.8+, PHP 8.0+"
• Dependencies: "Required NPM Packages: @paypal/checkout-server-sdk, dotenv"
• Environment Variables: Lists the exact env vars needed (e.g.,
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID, PAYPAL_SECRET_KEY).
2. Permissions & Data Access (Critical for Security/Compliance)
What level of access does this integration require? This is vital for security reviews.
• API Scopes: "This integration will request: read:transactions, write:subscriptions,
manage:webhooks"
• Data Accessed: "This integration will access: User email addresses, transaction
amounts, subscription statuses."
• Data Stored: "This integration will store: PayPal Transaction IDs, Subscription IDs
locally."
3. Configuration Steps (Helpful for Setup)
A quick, inline guide.
• Setup Steps:
o Create a PayPal Developer account.
o Create a new App to get credentials.
o Add your redirect URLs in the PayPal dashboard.
o Enter your credentials below and enable the integration.
4. Pricing & Rate Limits (Critical for Cost/Budgeting)
• Fee Structure: "PayPal Fees: 3.49% + $0.49 per transaction. Platform fees may
apply."
• Rate Limits: "API Rate Limit: 500 calls per minute. Webhook Limit: 5,000 events
per day."
• Free Tier: "First 1,000 transactions per month are free."
5. Support & Documentation (Critical for Troubleshooting)
• Support Type: "Support: Email, 24/5 Phone Support for Enterprise"
• Documentation: [Link to Internal Docs] | [Link to PayPal Official API Docs]
• API Health: [Link to PayPal System Status Page]
6. Advanced Features & Webhooks (For Power Users)

PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED, BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.ACTIVATED"
• Advanced Settings: "Options for: Sandbox mode, custom webhook endpoints, fee
handling."
