# Internal Server Error Resolution

**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Internal server errors preventing site from running  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved  

## Problem Description

The development server was experiencing critical internal errors that prevented the site from loading:

1. **MODULE_NOT_FOUND error** in `_document.js` file
2. **TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '/_app')**
3. **404 errors** for missing assets (`analytics-dashboard-preview.svg`)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Corrupted Build Cache
- Next.js was generating pages router files (`_app.js`, `_document.js`) despite using app router
- The `.next/server/pages/` directory contained conflicting build artifacts
- This caused module resolution conflicts and undefined property errors

### Secondary Issue: Missing Assets
- `analytics-dashboard-preview.svg` file was missing from `/public` directory
- Referenced in `PostDataAdapter.ts` but file didn't exist
- Caused 404 errors and potential JavaScript syntax errors

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Clean Build Cache
```bash
# Stop development server
# Remove corrupted build directory
rm -rf .next

# Clean pnpm cache
pnpm store prune

# Reinstall dependencies
pnpm install
```

### 2. Create Missing Assets
- Created `analytics-dashboard-preview.svg` in `/public` directory
- SVG contains analytics dashboard preview with charts and stats
- Resolves 404 errors and missing asset references

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- **Created:** `/public/analytics-dashboard-preview.svg`
- **Removed:** `.next/` directory (build cache)

### Error Patterns Resolved
- `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors in Next.js build
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '/_app')`
- `GET /analytics-dashboard-preview.svg 404` errors
- `GET /@vite/client 404` errors (resolved by cache clean)

## Prevention Measures

1. **Regular Cache Cleaning:** Periodically clean `.next` directory during development
2. **Asset Validation:** Ensure all referenced assets exist in `/public` directory
3. **Build Verification:** Monitor development server logs for 404 errors
4. **Dependency Management:** Keep pnpm cache clean and dependencies updated

## Outcome

- ✅ Development server running successfully on `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ All pages compiling without errors
- ✅ No more MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors
- ✅ No more undefined property errors
- ✅ All asset requests resolving successfully
- ✅ Site loading properly in browser

## Next Steps

1. Monitor server logs for any new errors
2. Verify all application features are working correctly
3. Consider implementing automated asset validation
4. Document any new assets added to prevent future 404s

**Resolution Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Impact:** Critical - Site completely non-functional → Fully operational  
**Complexity:** Medium - Required cache cleaning and asset creation
