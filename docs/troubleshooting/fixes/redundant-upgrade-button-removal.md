# Redundant Upgrade Button Removal

## Issue
The PostCard component had a redundant upgrade button in the BottomBar section that was unnecessary since there's already an overlay for locked content.

## Root Cause
Duplicate UI elements for the same functionality - both an overlay and a bottom bar upgrade button were present for locked content.

## Solution
Removed the redundant BottomBar upgrade button and cleaned up the unused BottomBar component from BasePostCard.

## Changes Made

### 1. PostCard.tsx
- Removed the entire BottomBar section (lines 243-261)
- Eliminated the upgrade button with gradient styling
- Removed the lock icon and pricing label logic

### 2. BasePostCard.tsx
- Removed the BottomBar component and its interface
- Removed BottomBar from the compound component export
- Cleaned up unused code to maintain lean architecture

## Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `PostCard.tsx`, `BasePostCard.tsx`
- **Components Removed**: BottomBar component and interface
- **UI Elements Removed**: Gradient upgrade button with lock icon
- **Functionality Preserved**: Overlay for locked content remains intact

## Outcome
- Cleaner UI without duplicate upgrade prompts
- Reduced code complexity
- Better user experience with single upgrade path
- Maintained existing overlay functionality

## Testing
- Verified no compilation errors
- Confirmed overlay still functions for locked content
- Validated no broken references to BottomBar component
