# Inline Actions Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the new inline actions system to replace the old modal-based post actions. The system provides a modern, mobile-first experience with smooth animations and proper accessibility.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Post Actions Registry (`src/features/post/stores/post-actions-registry.ts`)
- ✅ **Created**: React-safe store using `useSyncExternalStore`
- ✅ **Features**: Single card open policy, outside click detection, ESC key handling
- ✅ **State Management**: Centralized control for all post action panels

### 2. InlineActions Component (`src/features/post/components/InlineActions.tsx`)
- ✅ **Created**: Modern inline actions panel with motion animations
- ✅ **Features**: Role-aware action labels, smooth slide-in/out transitions
- ✅ **Actions**: Save, Share, Copy Link, Download, Report with proper icons
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### 3. PostCard Integration (`src/features/post/components/PostCard.tsx`)
- ✅ **Updated**: Integrated InlineActions with 3-dots button
- ✅ **Event Handling**: Proper click handlers and registry integration
- ✅ **Conditional Rendering**: Shows inline actions when registry state is active

### 4. PostActions Component Update (`src/features/post/components/PostActions.tsx`)
- ✅ **Modernized**: Updated to use new inline system instead of dropdown
- ✅ **Registry Integration**: Connected to post-actions registry for state management
- ✅ **Cleanup**: Removed old modal-related state and handlers

### 5. MainFeed Cleanup (`src/features/feed/components/main-feed.tsx`)
- ✅ **Removed**: Old PostActionsModal imports and usage
- ✅ **Cleaned**: Deleted deprecated modal state and handlers
- ✅ **Simplified**: Streamlined component with registry-based approach

### 6. File Cleanup
- ✅ **Deleted**: `src/features/feed/components/post-actions-modal.tsx`
- ✅ **Updated**: PostCSS configuration to use `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- ✅ **Fixed**: Build errors and linting issues
