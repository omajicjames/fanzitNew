# Import Path Fixes

## Issue
The project had inconsistent import paths using `@/` alias that needed to be standardized to `@src/` for better compatibility and consistency.

## What Was Fixed
- **All UI Components**: Updated 28+ UI components in `/src/components/ui/` to use `@src/lib/utils` instead of `@/lib/utils`
- **Layout Components**: Fixed import paths in sidebar and three-column-shell components
- **Feature Components**: Updated all feature components to use `@src/` prefix for UI component references

## Files Modified
### UI Components Fixed:
- accordion.tsx
- alert.tsx
- breadcrumb.tsx
- checkbox.tsx
- command.tsx (also fixed dialog import)
- context-menu.tsx
- dialog.tsx
- drawer.tsx
- dropdown-menu.tsx
- hover-card.tsx
- input-otp.tsx
- menubar.tsx
- navigation-menu.tsx
- popover.tsx
- progress.tsx
- radio-group.tsx
- resizable.tsx
- scroll-area.tsx
- select.tsx
- sheet.tsx
- slider.tsx
- switch.tsx
- table.tsx
- tabs.tsx
- toast.tsx
- tooltip.tsx

### Layout Components Fixed:
- sidebar.tsx
- three-column-shell.tsx

## Outcome
✅ **Build Success**: All import path changes were verified with a successful production build
✅ **No Errors**: Zero compilation errors after the fixes
✅ **Consistency**: All imports now use the standardized `@src/` alias
✅ **Performance**: Build completed in 4.7s with optimized bundle sizes

## Technical Details
- Changed from: `import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'`
- Changed to: `import { cn } from '@src/lib/utils'`
- Also updated component imports from `@/components/ui/*` to `@src/components/ui/*`

## Verification
The fixes were verified through:
1. Regex search to ensure no remaining `@/` imports
2. Successful production build with Next.js 15.5.3
3. All 9 pages compiled successfully
4. No TypeScript or linting errors
