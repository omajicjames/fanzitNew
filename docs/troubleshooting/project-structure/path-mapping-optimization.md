# Path Mapping Optimization - Option B Implementation

## Issue
Implemented explicit path mappings (Option B) for better organization and architectural guardrails in the Fanzit project.

## Root Cause
Previous path mapping used single `@/*` alias pointing to `./src/*`, which could lead to ambiguity and architectural drift in larger repositories.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated tsconfig.json Path Mappings
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"],           // repo root (lets you import "@/app/*" if you ever need it)
      "@app/*": ["./app/*"],    // App Router
      "@src/*": ["./src/*"]     // libraries/features
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Added ESLint Architectural Guardrails
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-restricted-imports": [
      "error",
      {
        "paths": [{ "name": "next/headers", "message": "Server-only; not in client components." }],
        "patterns": ["@src/db/*", "@src/server/*"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated All App Route Imports
Changed all imports in app directory from `@/` to `@src/` to match new path structure:

**Files Updated:**
- `/app/(public)/page.tsx`
- `/app/(protected)/analytics/page.tsx`
- `/app/(protected)/messages/page.tsx`
- `/app/(protected)/creator/profile/[id]/page.tsx`
- `/app/(protected)/creator/upload/page.tsx`
- `/app/(public)/auth/page.tsx`
- `/app/(protected)/wallet/page.tsx`
- `/app/layout.tsx`

## Actions Taken

1. **Path Mapping Update**: Modified `tsconfig.json` to use explicit aliases
2. **ESLint Rules**: Added architectural guardrails to prevent drift
3. **Import Updates**: Updated all app route files to use `@src/` for src directory imports
4. **Build Verification**: Confirmed successful compilation

## Build Results

✅ **Build Status**: SUCCESS
- Compiled successfully in 3.1s
- All 9 routes generated successfully
- No module resolution errors
- Path mappings working correctly

## Benefits

### Explicit Path Structure
- `@/*` - Repo root access (for future app imports if needed)
- `@app/*` - App Router specific imports
- `@src/*` - Libraries and features

### Architectural Guardrails
- Prevents UI/feature code from touching server/data directly
- Restricts `next/headers` usage in client components
- Prevents imports from `@src/db/*` and `@src/server/*` patterns

### Better Organization
- Clear separation between routing and business logic
- Explicit import paths reduce ambiguity
- Easier to maintain and scale

## Sanity Checklist Status

✅ One app/ directory at repo root  
✅ No leftover pages/ or brace-named folders  
✅ Aliases match chosen pattern (Option B)  
✅ Build succeeds with new path mappings  

## Next Steps

1. **Optional**: Add thin segment wrappers at `app/(public)/layout.tsx` and `app/(protected)/layout.tsx` if per-segment config is needed
2. **Monitor**: Watch for any import pattern violations via ESLint
3. **Consistency**: Ensure all future imports follow the new path mapping conventions

## Prevention Measures

1. **ESLint Integration**: Architectural rules will catch violations during development
2. **Path Mapping Documentation**: Clear aliases prevent confusion
3. **Build Verification**: Regular builds will catch any path resolution issues
