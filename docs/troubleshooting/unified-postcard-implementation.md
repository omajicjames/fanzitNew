# Unified PostCard Implementation

## Issue
The application had multiple PostCard variants (RegularPostCard, LockedPostCard) that created code duplication and maintenance overhead. The codebase needed a unified approach following the one_base_card_v3.md specification.

## Solution
Implemented a unified PostCard component using the BasePostCard compound component pattern.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated PostCard.tsx
- **Location**: `/src/features/post/PostCard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed imports for non-existent components (PostActions, LockedBranch, SmartVideo)
  - Implemented unified PostCard using BasePostCard compound components
  - Added proper media section with conditional rendering
  - Implemented direct engagement buttons instead of EngagementRow component
  - Added locked content overlay with blur effect and upgrade button
  - Added BottomBar for locked content with upgrade functionality

### 2. Cleaned Up Old Variants
- **Deleted Files**:
  - `/src/features/post/variants/RegularPostCard.tsx`
  - `/src/features/post/variants/LockedPostCard.tsx`
  - `/src/features/post/variants/` (entire directory)

### 3. Component Structure
The new unified PostCard follows this structure:
```
BasePostCard.Root
├── BasePostCard.Header (profile, timestamp, menu)
├── BasePostCard.Media (images/videos with locked overlay)
├── BasePostCard.Body (title, description)
├── BasePostCard.Actions (engagement buttons)
└── BasePostCard.BottomBar (upgrade button for locked content)
```

## Key Features
- **Mobile-first design**: Responsive layout optimized for mobile devices
- **Object-oriented approach**: Uses compound component pattern for modularity
- **Locked content handling**: Blur overlay with upgrade prompts
- **Engagement metrics**: Direct button implementation with SVG icons
- **Consistent styling**: Follows app's design system

## Files Modified
- `/src/features/post/PostCard.tsx` - Complete rewrite using unified approach

## Files Removed
- `/src/features/post/variants/RegularPostCard.tsx`
- `/src/features/post/variants/LockedPostCard.tsx`
- `/src/features/post/variants/` directory

## Outcome
- ✅ Single unified PostCard component
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Improved maintainability
- ✅ Consistent UI across all post types
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Object-oriented compound component pattern

## Testing
The component handles both regular and locked content states, with proper fallbacks for missing media and engagement data.
