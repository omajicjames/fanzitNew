# Analytics Content Fix - 2025-01-27

## Issue
**Problem**: Analytics Dashboard had the same content as Admin Dashboard
**Root Cause**: Analytics page was showing duplicate KPI cards and content from the admin dashboard
**Result**: Analytics page lost its unique analytics-focused content

## Root Cause Analysis
When the analytics page was moved to `/admin/analytics`, it retained the same KPI cards and content as the admin dashboard:
- **Duplicate KPIs**: Same "Total Users", "Verified Creators", "Total Posts", "Monthly Revenue"
- **Same Charts**: Identical "Revenue Analytics" and "User Growth" charts
- **No Analytics Focus**: Missing analytics-specific metrics and data

## Solution
Updated analytics page to have unique, analytics-focused content:

### 1. Analytics-Specific KPIs
**Before (Duplicate Admin KPIs):**
```typescript
title="Total Users" value={12847}
title="Verified Creators" value={1234}
title="Total Posts" value={45678}
title="Monthly Revenue" value={89432}
```

**After (Analytics KPIs):**
```typescript
title="Page Views" value={2540000}
title="Engagement Rate" value={78.5}
title="Conversion Rate" value={12.3}
title="Avg. Session Time" value={4.2}
```

### 2. Analytics-Focused Charts
**Before:**
- Revenue Analytics (duplicate)
- User Growth (duplicate)

**After:**
- **Traffic Analytics**: Page views and user sessions over time
- **Engagement Metrics**: User engagement and interaction rates

### 3. Analytics Data Tables
Added new analytics-specific content:
- **Top Performing Content**: Most viewed and engaged content with metrics
