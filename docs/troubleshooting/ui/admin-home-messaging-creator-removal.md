# Admin Home Page - Messaging and Creator Logic Removal

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Type:** UI Cleanup

## Issue
User requested removal of all messaging and creator logic from the admin home page sidebar, leaving a blank right side instead of the messaging panel.

## Root Cause
The admin home page was displaying:
1. MessagingPanel component in the right column
2. Messages button with notification badge in the sidebar
3. Subscriptions section with creator profiles in the sidebar

These components were cluttering the admin interface and not needed for the current use case.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/app/(public)/page.tsx`
**Before:**
```tsx
import { MessagingPanel } from "@src/features/messaging/components/messaging-panel"

<ThreeColumnShell 
  leftColumn={<Sidebar />} 
  centerColumn={<Timeline />} 
  rightColumn={<MessagingPanel />} 
/>
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Removed MessagingPanel import

<ThreeColumnShell 
  leftColumn={<Sidebar />} 
  centerColumn={<Timeline />} 
  rightColumn={<div className="h-full" />} 
/>
```

### 2. `/src/components/app/layout/sidebar.tsx`
**Before:**
```tsx
import { Badge } from "@src/components/ui/badge"
import { Home, Search, Heart, MessageCircle, User, Settings, TrendingUp, Star, Crown } from "lucide-react"

// Messages button with badge
<Button onClick={() => handleNavigation('/messages')}>
  <MessageCircle className="mr-3 h-5 w-5" />
  Messages
  <Badge variant="secondary" className="ml-auto">3</Badge>
</Button>

// Subscriptions section with creator profiles
<div className="space-y-3">
  <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
  {/* Creator profile buttons */}
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Removed Badge import and MessageCircle, Star icons
import { Home, Search, Heart, User, Settings, TrendingUp, Crown } from "lucide-react"

// Messages button and Subscriptions section completely removed
// Clean navigation with only essential buttons
```
