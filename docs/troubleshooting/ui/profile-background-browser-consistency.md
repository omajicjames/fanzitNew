# Profile Background Browser Consistency Fix

## Issue
The creator profile banner background was displaying different colors across browsers:
- Chrome: Displaying a pale/light background
- Firefox: Displaying a more bluish background
- User requirement: Consistent black background across all browsers

## Root Cause
The banner was using `bg-zinc-800` which can render differently across browsers due to:
- Browser-specific color profile interpretations
- Different rendering engines handling zinc color values
- Potential conflicts with gradient overlays and mix-blend modes

## Changes Made

### Background Color Standardization
- **Changed**: Banner background from `bg-zinc-800` to `bg-black`
- **Reason**: Pure black (`#000000`) renders consistently across all browsers
- **Maintained**: All overlay effects and gradient elements

### Technical Implementation

#### Before
```tsx
<div className="relative h-[72px] md:h-[96px] lg:h-[128px] w-full overflow-hidden bg-zinc-800">
```

#### After
```tsx
<div className="relative h-[72px] md:h-[96px] lg:h-[128px] w-full overflow-hidden bg-black">
```

### Preserved Elements
- Subtle glow effect overlay
- Cover image with mix-blend-overlay
- All z-index layering
- Responsive height adjustments

## Outcome
- Consistent black background across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Eliminated browser-specific color rendering variations
- Maintained all visual effects and design elements
- Improved cross-browser compatibility

## Files Modified
- `src/features/creator/components/creator-profile.tsx`

## Browser Testing Notes
- Pure black (`bg-black`) provides the most reliable cross-browser consistency
- Zinc colors can vary based on browser color profiles and rendering engines
- Black background enhances contrast for overlaid elements
