# Profile Middle Section Background Cross-Browser Fix

## Issue
The middle section of the creator profile page was displaying different background colors between browsers:
- Chrome: Consistent black background
- Firefox: Non-black background in the middle content area
- Root cause: Global CSS `--background` variable using oklch colors that render differently across browsers

## Root Cause Analysis
The main profile container was inheriting the global background color from CSS custom properties:
```css
--background: oklch(0.27 0.02 255); /* Zinc 800 equivalent */
```

Different browsers interpret oklch color values differently, causing:
- Chrome: Rendering closer to intended dark color
- Firefox: Rendering with different color interpretation
- Safari/Edge: Potential variations in color rendering

## Changes Made

### Main Container Background Override
- **Added**: Explicit `bg-black` class to main profile container
- **Reason**: Override global CSS variable inheritance with consistent black
- **Scope**: Entire profile page content area

### Technical Implementation

#### Before
```tsx
<div className="w-full space-y-0">
```

#### After
```tsx
<div className="w-full space-y-0 bg-black">
```

### Why This Fix Works
- Pure black (`#000000`) renders identically across all browsers
- Overrides CSS custom property inheritance
- Eliminates browser-specific color profile interpretations
- Provides consistent foundation for all child elements

## Outcome
- Consistent black background across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Eliminated middle section color variations
- Maintained all existing styling and functionality
- Improved cross-browser compatibility

## Files Modified
- `src/features/creator/components/creator-profile.tsx`

## Browser Testing Notes
- oklch colors can vary significantly between browser rendering engines
- Firefox tends to interpret oklch values differently than Chromium-based browsers
- Explicit color values (hex, rgb) provide better cross-browser consistency than CSS custom properties for critical backgrounds
- Consider using explicit colors for main layout backgrounds when cross-browser consistency is essential
