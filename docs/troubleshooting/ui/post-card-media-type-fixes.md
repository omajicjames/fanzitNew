# Post Card Media Type and Styling Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. SmartVideo Error on Photo Posts
**Problem**: Photo posts were displaying "No compatible video format found" error message
**Root Cause**: Mock data in PostDataAdapter had incorrect media type mapping - PNG images were marked as `type: "video"`
**Impact**: Poor user experience with confusing error messages on image content

### 2. Low Contrast Subtitle Text
**Problem**: Card subtitles had insufficient contrast compared to titles
**Root Cause**: Description component used `text-muted-foreground` which was too light
**Impact**: Reduced readability and accessibility issues

## Fixes Applied

### Media Type Correction
**File**: `/src/features/post/adapters/PostDataAdapter.ts`
**Changes**:
- Fixed post-3 mock data: changed `type: "video"` to `type: "image"` for PNG file
- Removed `durationSec` property from image media
- Updated `altText` from "Morning yoga flow video" to "Morning yoga flow image"

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
media: {
  type: "video",
  url: "/digital-art-portrait.png",
  thumbnailUrl: "/digital-art-portrait.png",
  durationSec: 945,
  altText: "Morning yoga flow video"
}

// After
media: {
  type: "image",
  url: "/digital-art-portrait.png",
  thumbnailUrl: "/digital-art-portrait.png",
  altText: "Morning yoga flow image"
}
```

### Subtitle Contrast Improvement
**File**: `/src/features/post/BasePostCard.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Updated Description component styling from `text-muted-foreground` to `text-foreground/80`
- Improved comment to reflect contrast enhancement

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
'text-sm text-muted-foreground',

// After
'text-sm text-foreground/80',
```

## Design System Tokens Used

- `text-foreground/80`: Provides 80% opacity of foreground color for better contrast while maintaining theme compatibility
- Maintains mobile-first responsive design with `sm:text-base`
- Preserves accessibility features like `line-clamp-3` and `leading-relaxed`

## Testing Verification

✅ Photo posts no longer display video format errors
✅ Subtitle text has improved contrast and readability
✅ Theme compatibility maintained across light/dark modes
✅ Mobile-first responsive design preserved
✅ No browser console errors affecting functionality

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits
- **User Experience**: Eliminated confusing error messages on image content
- **Accessibility**: Improved text contrast for better readability
- **Content Accuracy**: Media types now correctly match file formats
- **Design Consistency**: Maintained theme-compatible styling approach

### Architecture Considerations
- Mock data now accurately represents real-world content types
- Component styling follows design system best practices
- Changes are backward compatible with existing implementations

## Prevention Guidelines

1. **Media Type Validation**: Always verify media type matches file extension
2. **Contrast Testing**: Use accessibility tools to verify text contrast ratios
3. **Mock Data Accuracy**: Ensure test data reflects realistic content scenarios
4. **Component Testing**: Test components with various content types
