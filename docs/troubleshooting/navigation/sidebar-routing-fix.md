# Sidebar Navigation Routing Fix

## Issue Description
The sidebar navigation tabs (Home, Explore, Trending, Liked, Messages, Profile, Settings) were not functional - they appeared as static buttons without any routing functionality.

## Root Cause
The sidebar component was using static Button components without:
- Next.js navigation imports
- Click handlers for routing
- Proper route definitions for all navigation items

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Sidebar Component
**File:** `/src/components/app/layout/sidebar.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `useRouter` import from `next/navigation`
- Created `handleNavigation` function to manage routing
- Added `onClick` handlers to all navigation buttons
- Added comprehensive function-level comments

**Navigation Routes Added:**
- Home: `/` (existing)
- Explore: `/explore` (new page created)
- Trending: `/trending` (new page created) 
- Liked: `/liked` (new page created)
- Messages: `/messages` (existing)
- Profile: `/creator/profile/1` (existing)
- Settings: `/settings` (new page created)

### 2. Created Missing Route Pages

#### Explore Page
**File:** `/app/(protected)/explore/page.tsx`
- Content discovery interface
- Categories: Trending Now, New Creators, Categories, Search
- Uses ThreeColumnShell layout

#### Trending Page
**File:** `/app/(protected)/trending/page.tsx`
- Trending content metrics and analytics
- Hot Now, Last 24h, Rising Fast sections
- Top trending content list with growth indicators
- Fixed Lucide React icon import (Fire â†’ Flame)

#### Liked Page
**File:** `/app/(protected)/liked/page.tsx`
- User's liked content collection
- Statistics: Total Liked, Creators, Recent activity
- Grid view of liked posts with timestamps
- Empty state handling

#### Settings Page
**File:** `/app/(protected)/settings/page.tsx`
- Tabbed interface: Profile, Notifications, Privacy, Billing
- Profile information management
- Notification preferences with toggles
- Privacy and security controls
- Billing and payment method management

## Technical Details

### Navigation Handler Implementation
```typescript
const handleNavigation = (path: string) => {
  router.push(path)
}
```

### Button Click Handler Example
```typescript
<Button
  variant="ghost"
  className="w-full justify-start text-sidebar-foreground hover:bg-sidebar-accent hover:text-sidebar-accent-foreground"
  onClick={() => handleNavigation('/')}
>
  <Home className="mr-3 h-5 w-5" />
  Home
</Button>
```

## Testing Results
- All sidebar navigation buttons now functional
- Proper routing to existing and new pages
- Consistent layout using ThreeColumnShell
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Proper icon imports resolved

## Files Modified
1. `/src/components/app/layout/sidebar.tsx` - Added routing functionality
2. `/app/(protected)/explore/page.tsx` - New page created
3. `/app/(protected)/trending/page.tsx` - New page created
4. `/app/(protected)/liked/page.tsx` - New page created
5. `/app/(protected)/settings/page.tsx` - New page created

## Outcome
Sidebar navigation is now fully functional with proper Next.js routing. Users can navigate between all sections of the application using the sidebar tabs. All new pages follow the established design patterns and use the three-column layout for consistency.
