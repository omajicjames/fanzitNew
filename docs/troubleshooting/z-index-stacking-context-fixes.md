# Z-Index Stacking Context Fixes

## Issue Description
Avatars and media content were escaping their card containers and creating stacking context issues that interfered with the header navigation. Elements with transform, opacity, and filter properties were creating accidental stacking contexts.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Overflow Control**: Card containers lacked `overflow-hidden` to contain media elements
2. **Accidental Stacking Contexts**: CSS properties like `opacity`, `transform`, and `filter` were creating unintended stacking contexts
3. **Improper Z-Index Hierarchy**: Inconsistent z-index values across components

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Card Media Container Fixes
**Files Modified:**
- `/src/features/feed/components/main-feed.tsx`
- `/src/features/creator/components/creator-profile.tsx` 
- `/src/features/payments/components/pay-per-view-modal.tsx`

**Changes Applied:**
- Added `overflow-hidden z-0` to image container divs
- Added `z-0` to img elements and content overlays
- Added `z-10` to duration badges and interactive elements

### 2. Stacking Context Audit and Fixes
**Files Modified:**
- `/src/features/creator/components/creator-profile.tsx`
- `/src/features/post-actions/InlineActions.tsx`
- `/src/features/feed/components/post-actions-modal.tsx`

**Changes Applied:**
- Replaced `opacity` transitions with `visibility` transitions to avoid stacking contexts
- Added proper z-index control (`z-10`, `z-30`) to animated components
- Ensured modal components stay within their designated layers

### 3. Global Z-Index Hierarchy
**Root Layout:** `/app/layout.tsx`
- Body already has `relative isolate` for proper stacking context isolation

**Header Component:** `/src/features/feed/components/main-feed.tsx`
- Sticky header uses `z-40` to stay above content
- Main content container uses `relative z-0` for proper containment

## Z-Index Hierarchy Established
```css
z-0   : Default content, card containers, media elements
z-10  : Interactive elements, badges, buttons within cards
z-30  : Modal content, action sheets
z-40  : Sticky headers, navigation tabs
z-50  : Modal overlays, backdrops
z-60+ : System-level elements (navigation, consent)
```

## Object-Oriented Programming Implementation
All components follow OOP principles:
- **Encapsulation**: Each component manages its own z-index scope
- **Inheritance**: Child elements inherit proper stacking context from parents
- **Polymorphism**: Different card types (feed, creator profile, pay-per-view) use consistent stacking patterns

## Mobile-First Design Considerations
- Z-index hierarchy works consistently across all screen sizes
- Touch interactions properly respect stacking order
- Modal overlays adapt to mobile viewport constraints

## Testing Verification
### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Avatars and media stay contained within card boundaries
- ✅ Content scrolls naturally under sticky header
- ✅ Interactive elements maintain proper layering
- ✅ Modal overlays appear above content but below system controls

### Files Affected
- Main feed cards with media content
- Creator profile content grids
- Pay-per-view modal image containers
- Animated action components

## Prevention Guidelines
1. Always use `overflow-hidden` on media containers
2. Assign explicit z-index values following the established hierarchy
3. Avoid opacity animations that create stacking contexts
4. Use `visibility` instead of `opacity` for show/hide transitions
5. Test stacking behavior across different screen sizes

## Status
- ✅ Card media containment implemented
- ✅ Stacking context audit completed
- ✅ Z-index hierarchy established
- ✅ Mobile-first design maintained
- ✅ Object-oriented structure preserved
