# Consent System Implementation Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Import Path Standardization
**Issue**: Mixed usage of `@/` and `@src/` import paths causing module resolution errors
**Fix**: Standardized all imports to use `@src/` prefix across all consent components
**Files Affected**:
- `/src/features/consent/CookieBanner.tsx`
- `/app/providers/consent-provider.tsx`
- `/src/features/consent/SlimCookieBar.tsx`

### 2. Missing Component Dependencies
**Issue**: `ConsentPreferencesDialog` component was referenced but not implemented
**Fix**: Created inline `DialogContent` structure with consent rows and action buttons
**Location**: `/src/features/consent/CookieBanner.tsx`

### 3. Code Duplication and Modularity
**Issue**: Type definitions and cookie management logic duplicated across files
**Fix**: 
- Created centralized types in `/src/features/consent/types.ts`
- Created cookie utilities in `/src/features/consent/cookies.ts`
- Refactored all components to use shared modules

### 4. Context API Simplification
**Issue**: Overly complex `ConsentCookieManager` class pattern
**Fix**: Simplified to direct hook-based state management with utility functions
**Location**: `/src/features/consent/ConsentContext.tsx`

### 5. Missing File Structure
**Issue**: Several referenced files didn't exist in the codebase
**Fix**: Created missing files:
- `/src/features/consent/SlimCookieBar.tsx`
- `/app/providers/consent-provider.tsx`
- `/app/(public)/legal/cookies/page.tsx`

## Architecture Improvements

### Object-Oriented Design Implementation
- Implemented proper component composition patterns
- Used React hooks for state management following OOP principles
- Created reusable utility classes for cookie management

### Mobile-First Design
- `SlimCookieBar` component optimized for mobile with minimal visual weight
- Responsive design patterns in all consent components
- Touch-friendly button sizing and spacing

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of consent dialogs
- Efficient state management with `useCallback` hooks
- Minimal re-renders through proper dependency arrays

## File Structure Created

```

├── types.ts              # Core types and constants
├── cookies.ts            # Cookie management utilities
├── ConsentContext.tsx    # React context and provider
├── CookieBanner.tsx      # Full-featured consent banner
├── SlimCookieBar.tsx     # Minimal consent bar
└── GatedScripts.tsx      # Conditional script loading

```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test consent state persistence across browser sessions
2. Verify mobile responsiveness on various screen sizes
3. Test script loading/unloading based on consent changes
4. Validate accessibility with screen readers
5. Test cookie banner behavior in different browsers

## Future Enhancements

1. Add consent analytics tracking
2. Implement consent version management
3. Add support for regional compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
4. Create automated testing suite for consent flows
