# Three Column Shell Duplication Fix

## Issue Summary
Fixed duplication of layout elements at certain breakpoints where both desktop and mobile layouts were visible simultaneously, causing poor responsive behavior compared to the home page.

## Root Cause
The `ThreeColumnShell` component had both desktop and mobile layouts without proper responsive visibility controls:
- Desktop layout (3-column) was always visible
- Mobile layout (single-column overlay) was only hidden with `lg:hidden`
- At the `lg` breakpoint transition, both layouts could be visible simultaneously

## Problem Identified
**File:** `/src/components/app/layout/three-column-shell.tsx`

### Before Fix
```tsx
{/* Desktop layout - always visible */}
<div className="flex h-screen">
  {/* Three columns */}
</div>

{/* Mobile layout - hidden only on lg+ */}
<div className="lg:hidden fixed inset-0 bg-background">
  {/* Single column */}
</div>
```

### Issue
- Desktop layout had no responsive hiding
- Mobile layout only used `lg:hidden`
- Both layouts could appear during breakpoint transitions
- Caused duplication of content and poor UX

## Fix Applied

### Updated Responsive Classes
**File:** `/src/components/app/layout/three-column-shell.tsx`

```tsx
{/* Desktop layout - hidden on mobile, visible on lg+ */}
<div className="hidden lg:flex h-screen">
  {/* Three columns */}
</div>

{/* Mobile layout - visible on mobile, hidden on lg+ */}
<div className="lg:hidden fixed inset-0 bg-background">
  {/* Single column */}
</div>
```

### Changes Made
1. **Desktop Layout**: Added `hidden lg:flex` classes
   - `hidden`: Hides by default (mobile)
   - `lg:flex`: Shows as flex on large screens

2. **Mobile Layout**: Kept `lg:hidden`
   - Visible by default (mobile)
   - Hidden on large screens

3. **Added Comments**: Documented layout purposes and responsive behavior

## Technical Details

### Breakpoint Behavior
- **Mobile (< 1024px)**: Only mobile layout visible
- **Desktop (≥ 1024px)**: Only desktop layout visible
- **Transition**: Clean switch between layouts, no overlap

### Layout Structure
- **Desktop**: Three-column layout with sidebar, main content, messaging panel
- **Mobile**: Single-column overlay with header, content, bottom navigation

## Testing Results
- ✅ No duplication at any breakpoint
- ✅ Smooth responsive transitions
- ✅ Consistent behavior with home page
- ✅ Application compiles without errors

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/app/layout/three-column-shell.tsx`
