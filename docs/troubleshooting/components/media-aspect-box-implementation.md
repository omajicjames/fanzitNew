# Media Aspect Box Implementation Fix

## Issue Description
Implemented the 5-step media aspect box fix as outlined in `docs/media_aspect_box.md` to ensure consistent 16:9 aspect ratio for all media content in both locked and unlocked post states.

## Root Cause
The original implementation lacked consistent aspect ratio containers and proper absolute positioning for media elements, causing inconsistent scaling and cropping behavior across different screen sizes.

## Files Modified

### 1. PostCard.tsx
- **Location**: `/src/features/post/PostCard.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added import for `AspectRatio` component from `@src/components/ui/aspect-ratio`
  - Wrapped media section in `AspectRatio` component with 16/9 ratio
  - Applied `absolute inset-0` classes to both `LockedBranch` and media divs
  - Fixed syntax error (removed stray curly brace)

### 2. LockedBranch.tsx
- **Location**: `/src/features/paywall/components/LockedBranch.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added optional `className` prop to Props interface
  - Updated component parameters to accept `className`
  - Passed `className` prop through to `LockedPostShell`

### 3. LockedPostShell.tsx
- **Location**: `/src/features/paywall/components/LockedPostShell.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added optional `className` prop to Props interface
  - Restructured component from Card-based to div-based layout
  - Implemented absolute positioning with `absolute inset-0` for media preview
  - Added `object-cover` styling for proper image scaling
  - Fixed conditional class assignment for tier badges (replaced object indexing with ternary operators)
  - Maintained glass overlay effect and tier configuration display

## Implementation Details

### Aspect Ratio Container
```tsx
<AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9} className="relative w-full overflow-hidden rounded-t-xl">
  {/* Media content with absolute positioning */}
</AspectRatio>
```

### Absolute Positioning Pattern
```tsx
<div className="absolute inset-0">
  {/* Media elements with object-cover */}
</div>
```

### Object-Cover Implementation
```tsx
<img 
  className="h-full w-full object-cover transition-all duration-300" 
  alt="Content preview"
/>
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ Preview opens without compilation errors
- ✅ Development server runs successfully
- ✅ Consistent 16:9 aspect ratio maintained across all media types
- ✅ Smooth scaling behavior without cropping issues
- ✅ Both locked and unlocked states use identical geometry

## Technical Notes
- Used mobile-first design principles throughout implementation
- Maintained object-oriented programming patterns
- Followed existing app naming conventions
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing paywall system
- Preserved all existing functionality while improving responsive behavior

## Resolution Status
**RESOLVED** - Media aspect box implementation completed successfully. All media content now maintains consistent 16:9 aspect ratio with proper scaling behavior across different screen sizes.
