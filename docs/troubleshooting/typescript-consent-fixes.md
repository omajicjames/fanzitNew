# TypeScript Consent System Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing ConsentState Export
**Problem**: `ConsentState` type was not exported from ConsentContext, causing import errors in other components.

**Solution**: Added re-export of `ConsentState` from `./types` in ConsentContext.tsx
```typescript
export { ConsentState } from './types';
```

### 2. Global Type Declaration Conflicts
**Problem**: Duplicate global declarations for `gtag`, `fbq`, and `hj` with mismatched modifiers and types.

**Solution**: 
- Made global type declarations optional with `?` operator
- Removed duplicate declarations in GatedScripts.tsx
- Centralized global types in ConsentContext.tsx

### 3. Missing 'acknowledged' Property
**Problem**: Components were referencing `hasAcknowledged` property that didn't exist in the updated `ConsentState` interface.

**Solution**:
- Updated `ConsentState` interface to include `acknowledged: boolean` and `updatedAt: string | null`
- Updated all components to use `consent.acknowledged` instead of `hasAcknowledged`
- Removed `hasAcknowledged` from ConsentContextValue type

### 4. Type Mismatch in setConsent Function
**Problem**: `setConsent` function expected `Omit<ConsentState, "updatedAt" | "acknowledged">` but components were passing full ConsentState objects.

**Solution**:
- Updated `acceptAll` and `acceptNecessaryOnly` functions to directly call `setConsentState`
- Simplified consent update logic to avoid type conflicts
- Ensured proper handling of `acknowledged` and `updatedAt` fields

### 5. Null Return Type Issue
**Problem**: `readConsentCookie()` could return null but useState expected ConsentState.

**Solution**: Added fallback to `defaultConsent` in state initialization:
```typescript
const [consent, setConsentState] = useState<ConsentState>(() => readConsentCookie() || defaultConsent)
```

## Files Modified

1. `/src/features/consent/ConsentContext.tsx`
   - Added ConsentState re-export
   - Fixed global type declarations
   - Updated acceptAll/acceptNecessaryOnly functions
   - Fixed state initialization with null fallback

2. `/src/features/consent/GatedScripts.tsx`
   - Updated ConsentState import path
   - Removed duplicate global declarations

3. `/src/features/consent/types.ts`
   - Added `acknowledged` and `updatedAt` properties to ConsentState
   - Updated defaultConsent object

4. `/src/features/consent/CookieBanner.tsx`
   - Updated to use `consent.acknowledged`
   - Fixed type errors in consent handling

5. `/src/features/consent/SlimCookieBar.tsx`
   - Updated to use `consent.acknowledged` instead of `hasAcknowledged`

## Architecture Improvements

### Object-Oriented Design
- Centralized consent state management in ConsentProvider class-like component
- Proper encapsulation of consent logic and state
- Clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic

### Mobile-First Design
- SlimCookieBar component optimized for mobile screens
- Responsive consent banner with proper touch targets
- Minimal visual weight for better mobile UX

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all consent-related types
- Proper type guards and null checking
- Eliminated any implicit 'any' types

## Testing Status

✅ **Compilation**: All TypeScript errors resolved
✅ **Runtime**: No browser console errors
✅ **Functionality**: Consent system working as expected
✅ **Mobile**: Responsive design verified

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for consent components
2. Add integration tests for consent flow
3. Verify GDPR/CCPA compliance
4. Add accessibility testing
5. Performance optimization review
