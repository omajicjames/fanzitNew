# PostActionsModal Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a mobile-native bottom sheet modal for post actions with role-based visibility, gesture controls, and micro-UX enhancements.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/src/features/feed/components/post-actions-modal.tsx` - Main modal component

### Modified Files
- `/src/features/feed/components/main-feed.tsx` - Integrated modal with feed
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Added Toaster component for notifications

## Features Implemented

### 1. Bottom Sheet Animation
- Slides up from bottom with smooth CSS transitions
- Mobile-first design with thumb-friendly positioning
- Fixed positioning at bottom of viewport
- Rounded top corners for native feel

### 2. Role-Based Action Grouping

#### For Creators (their own posts)
**Primary Controls:**
- Edit Post ✏️
- Delete Post 🗑️ 
- Pin to Profile 📌

**Secondary/Engagement:**
- Share on Social Media 🔗
- Manual Twitter Post 🐦

**Safety & Management:**
- Turn Off Comments 🚫💬
- Report a Problem ⚠️

#### For Subscribers (viewing creator's posts)
**Engagement:**
- Re-Post 🔄
- Share Outside App 🔗

**Subscriber Tools:**
- Pin Post 📌
- Save Post 💾

**Community/Safety:**
- Report Post ⚠️
- Block Creator 🚷

### 3. Micro-UX Enhancements

#### Dynamic Header
- Shows "Post by @username" for context
- Maintains user awareness of whose content they're interacting with

#### Gesture Controls
- **Swipe down to dismiss:** Touch gesture detection with 100px threshold
- **Tap outside to close:** Backdrop click handling
- **Visual feedback:** Transform and opacity changes during drag

#### Feedback Animations
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Success messages with appropriate context
- Immediate visual feedback for user actions

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### State Management
```typescript
// Touch gesture state
const [startY, setStartY] = useState(0)
const [currentY, setCurrentY] = useState(0)
const [isDragging, setIsDragging] = useState(false)

// Modal state
const [selectedPost, setSelectedPost] = useState<Post | null>(null)
const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false)
```

#### Toast Integration
- Uses existing `useToast` hook from `@src/hooks/use-toast`
- Added Toaster component to root layout
- Action-specific success messages

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px)
- Proper spacing for thumb navigation
- Bottom sheet positioning for reachability

## Usage Example

```tsx
<PostActionsModal
  isOpen={isModalOpen}
  onClose={handleCloseModal}
  post={selectedPost}
  currentUser={currentUser}
  onAction={handleAction}
/>
```

## Integration Points

### MainFeed Component
- Added state management for modal
- Connected MoreHorizontal button to open modal
- Implemented action handlers with toast feedback

### Toast System
- Leverages existing toast infrastructure
- Provides immediate feedback for all user actions
- Consistent messaging across all action types

## Performance Considerations

- Modal only renders when open (conditional rendering)
- Gesture detection only active when modal is open
- Efficient state updates with proper cleanup
- Minimal re-renders through optimized state structure

## Accessibility Features

- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly structure
- High contrast icon and text combinations

## Future Enhancements

- Add haptic feedback for mobile devices
- Implement custom animations for different actions
- Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Support for batch actions on multiple posts

## Testing Notes

- Modal integrates seamlessly with existing feed
- All gesture controls work as expected
- Toast notifications display properly
- Role-based actions show/hide correctly
- Mobile responsiveness verified
