# React Import Fix - 2025-01-27

## Issue
**Error**: `React is not defined` in analytics page
**Location**: `app/(protected)/analytics/page.tsx (134:35)`
**Context**: `class MetricCardComponent extends React.Component<MetricCardProps>`

## Root Cause
The analytics page was using `React.Component` and `React.ComponentType` but didn't have React imported. In modern React applications, you need to explicitly import React when using React-specific types and classes.

## Solution
Added React import to the analytics page:

```typescript
"use client";

import React from "react";
import { AdminPillNavigationComponent } from "@src/components/admin/AdminPillNavigation";
// ... other imports
```

## Files Modified
- `/app/(protected)/analytics/page.tsx` - Added `import React from "react";`

## Technical Details
- **Issue**: Missing React import for `React.Component` and `React.ComponentType` usage
- **Fix**: Added explicit React import at the top of the file
- **Result**: Component now properly extends React.Component without errors

## Verification
- ✅ Build successful (`npm run build`)
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Component renders correctly
- ✅ TypeScript types working properly

## Prevention
When using React-specific types or classes in Next.js:
1. Always import React explicitly: `import React from "react";`
2. Use React.Component for class components
3. Use React.ComponentType for component type definitions
4. Ensure all React types are properly imported

## Related Components
- `MetricCardComponent` - Now properly extends React.Component
- `MetricCardProps` interface - Uses React.ComponentType properly
- Analytics page - Fully functional with dark theme

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - React import added, error eliminated
