# TypeScript Path Mapping Errors

## Issue
TypeScript was reporting module resolution errors for `@/` imports, showing "Cannot find module '@/components/ui/button' or its corresponding type declarations" even though the actual files were located in different paths.

## Root Cause
The `tsconfig.json` file contained conflicting path mappings:
- Old `@/*` mapping pointing to repo root (`["./*"]`)
- New `@src/*` mapping pointing to source directory (`["./src/*"]`)

This caused TypeScript to look for files in the wrong locations, particularly when IDE extensions tried to resolve imports using the old `@/` alias.

## What Was Fixed
- **Removed obsolete path mapping**: Deleted `"@/*": ["./*"]` from tsconfig.json
- **Kept standardized mappings**: Maintained `@app/*` and `@src/*` path mappings
- **Updated all import statements**: Previously fixed all `@/` imports to use `@src/` instead

## Files Modified
### Configuration:
- `tsconfig.json` - Removed conflicting `@/*` path mapping

### Import Path Updates (Previously Completed):
- All UI components in `/src/components/ui/`
- All feature components in `/src/features/`
- All layout components in `/src/components/app/layout/`

## Technical Details
**Before:**
```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./*"],           // repo root (conflicting)
  "@app/*": ["./app/*"],    // App Router
  "@src/*": ["./src/*"]     // libraries/features
}
```

**After:**
```json
"paths": {
  "@app/*": ["./app/*"],    // App Router
  "@src/*": ["./src/*"]     // libraries/features
}
```

## Outcome
✅ **TypeScript Errors Resolved**: No more module resolution errors
✅ **Build Success**: Production build completed in 2.4s with no errors
✅ **Consistent Path Mapping**: Only standardized aliases remain
✅ **IDE Support**: Better IntelliSense and auto-completion

## Prevention
- Always remove obsolete path mappings when standardizing import aliases
- Use consistent import patterns across the entire codebase
- Test both development and production builds after path mapping changes
- Ensure IDE TypeScript service restarts after tsconfig.json changes
