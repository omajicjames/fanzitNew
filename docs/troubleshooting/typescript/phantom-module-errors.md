# Phantom TypeScript Module Errors

## Issue
TypeScript/IDE was reporting module resolution errors for files that don't exist, showing errors like:
- "Cannot find module '@/components/ui/button' or its corresponding type declarations"
- Errors pointing to non-existent file paths like `/src/components/auth/login-form.tsx`

## Root Cause
This issue occurs when:
1. **IDE TypeScript Cache**: The IDE's TypeScript language service cached old file references
2. **Path Mapping Changes**: After updating import paths and tsconfig.json, the IDE didn't refresh its internal cache
3. **Stale References**: Old import statements or file locations were still cached in memory

## What Was Fixed
- **TypeScript Service Refresh**: Ran `pnpm tsc --noEmit` to force TypeScript to recheck all files
- **Cache Clearing**: This cleared any stale references to non-existent files
- **Path Mapping Update**: Previously removed conflicting `@/*` path mapping from tsconfig.json

## Resolution Steps
1. **Run Type Check**: Execute `pnpm tsc --noEmit` to force TypeScript revalidation
2. **Restart IDE**: If errors persist, restart your IDE/editor
3. **Clear TypeScript Cache**: Delete `.next` folder if using Next.js
4. **Verify Paths**: Ensure all import statements use correct, existing file paths

## Commands Used
```bash
# Force TypeScript to recheck all files
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Alternative: Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart development server
pnpm dev
```

## Outcome
✅ **Phantom Errors Resolved**: TypeScript check completed with no errors
✅ **Clean Build**: Production build continues to work correctly
✅ **IDE Sync**: Editor now shows accurate error states
✅ **Cache Cleared**: No more references to non-existent files

## Prevention
- Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` after major import path changes
- Restart IDE TypeScript service after tsconfig.json modifications
- Clear build cache when experiencing persistent phantom errors
- Use consistent import patterns to avoid path confusion
