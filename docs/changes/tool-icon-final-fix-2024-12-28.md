# Final Tool Icon Fix - December 28, 2024

## Issue
Remaining `Tool` icon reference in maintenance page at line 339 that was missed in previous fixes.

## Root Cause
Incomplete search and replace operation - there was a `Tool` icon in the Quick Actions section that wasn't caught in the initial fix.

## Resolution
Replaced the remaining `<Tool className="h-4 w-4" />` with `<Wrench className="h-4 w-4" />` in the System Cleanup button.

## Files Modified
- `/Users/wizguy16/Downloads/fanzit/app/(protected)/admin/system/maintenance/page.tsx` (line 339)

## Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully (exit code 0)
- ✅ Development server running without errors
- ✅ No more Tool icon imports found in codebase
- ✅ All admin system pages compiling properly

## Complete Icon Replacement Summary
All `Tool` icons have been successfully replaced with `Wrench` icons:
1. Import statement - `import { Wrench } from "lucide-react"`
2. `getStatusIcon` function - returns `<Wrench className="h-5 w-5" />`
3. Quick Actions button - `<Wrench className="h-4 w-4" />`

## Status
All Tool icon issues are now resolved. The application builds and runs without any icon-related errors.
