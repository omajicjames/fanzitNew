# Admin System Management Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive admin system management pages and removed system status functionality from the FAQ page as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. FAQ System Status Removal
**Location**: `/src/features/admin/components/AdminFaqClient.tsx`

- Proper TypeScript interfaces

## Testing Results
