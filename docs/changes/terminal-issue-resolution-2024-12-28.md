# Terminal Issue Resolution - December 28, 2024

## Issue
Development server was failing to start due to port conflicts and stale processes.

## Root Cause
- Previous development server processes were still running on ports 3000 and 3001
- Server restart was needed after build fixes to pick up import path changes

## Resolution Steps
1. **Identified Port Conflicts**: Used `lsof -ti:3000,3001` to find processes using ports
2. **Killed Stale Processes**: Terminated processes with PIDs 42863 and 71815
3. **Restarted Dev Server**: Successfully started fresh development server on port 3000

## Files Affected
- `/Users/wizguy16/Downloads/fanzit/src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` (already had correct imports)
- Development server process management

## Verification
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ No compilation errors in terminal
- ✅ Ready in 1523ms

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any runtime errors
- Test admin pages functionality
- Verify all build fixes are working in development mode
