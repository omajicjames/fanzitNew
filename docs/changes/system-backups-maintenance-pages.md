# System Backups and Maintenance Pages Implementation

## Overview
Completed the implementation of the missing system management pages: Backups and Maintenance. These pages provide comprehensive management interfaces for system backup operations and maintenance tasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. System Backups Page (`/admin/system/backups`)
- **File**: `/app/(protected)/admin/system/backups/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Database and file backup management
  - Backup scheduling and automation
  - Backup history with status tracking
  - Storage usage monitoring
  - Backup restoration capabilities
  - Filter and search functionality

### 2. System Maintenance Page (`/admin/system/maintenance`)
- **File**: `/app/(protected)/admin/system/maintenance/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Maintenance task scheduling
  - System maintenance mode toggle
  - Task status tracking (pending, running, completed, failed)
  - Maintenance history and logs
  - Priority-based task management
  - Filter and search capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Authentication**: Both pages use `requireAdminPage()` HOC for admin access control
- **Design Pattern**: Object-oriented programming with React functional components
- **Styling**: Mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state management
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons for consistent UI

### Key Components
- Status badges with color-coded indicators
- Statistics cards for quick overview
- Interactive tables with sorting and filtering
- Action buttons for management operations
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Mock Data Structure
- **Backups**: ID, name, type, size, status, created date, retention period
- **Maintenance Tasks**: ID, name, type, status, priority, scheduled time, duration

## Navigation Integration
Both pages are accessible through the existing System Management navigation:
- `/admin/system/backups` - System Backups
- `/admin/system/maintenance` - System Maintenance

## Testing Results
- ✅ Both pages compile successfully
- ✅ Pages load without errors (200 status codes)
- ✅ Navigation integration working correctly
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design implemented
- ✅ Authentication protection in place

## Available Routes
- `/admin/system/backups` - Backup management interface
- `/admin/system/maintenance` - Maintenance task management
- Both pages integrate with existing admin navigation structure

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing real backend integration for backup operations
- Add real-time status updates for maintenance tasks
- Implement actual backup scheduling functionality
- Add notification system for maintenance alerts
