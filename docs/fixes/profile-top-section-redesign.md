# Profile Top Section Redesign

## Overview
Redesigned the creator profile top section with a modern banner layout and collapsible bio functionality to improve user experience and visual appeal.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modern Banner Design
- **File Modified**: `/src/features/creator/components/creator-profile.tsx`
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added gradient banner background with overlay effect
  - Positioned avatar over the banner for modern layered look
  - Implemented responsive height (h-32 on mobile, h-40 on larger screens)
  - Used backdrop blur and opacity effects for visual depth

### 2. Profile Header Restructure
- **Layout Changes**:
  - Moved avatar to overlap banner with negative margin
  - Reorganized creator info, stats, and action buttons
  - Improved spacing and alignment for better visual hierarchy
  - Added proper mobile-first responsive design

### 3. Collapsible Bio Section
- **Interactive Feature**:
  - Added upside-down caret (^) icon next to "Bio" text
  - Implemented toggle functionality with state management
  - Smooth expand/collapse animation using Tailwind classes
  - Icon rotates based on expanded state (ChevronUp/ChevronDown)

### 4. State Management
- **Added State**: `isBioExpanded` boolean state
- **Toggle Function**: Click handler for bio section expansion
- **Icons**: Imported ChevronUp and ChevronDown from lucide-react
