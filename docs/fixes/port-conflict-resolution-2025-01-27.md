# Port Conflict Resolution - 2025-01-27

## Issue Description
The development server failed to start with the following error:
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Root Cause
Port 3000 was already occupied by a previous development server process that wasn't properly terminated.

## Solution Applied
1. **Killed existing process on port 3000:**
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. **Restarted development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Outcome
- ✅ **Server Status**: Successfully running on port 3000
- ✅ **HTTP Response**: 200 OK
- ✅ **No More Port Conflicts**: Clean server startup

## Prevention
To avoid this issue in the future:
- Always use `Ctrl+C` to properly stop the development server
- If the server doesn't stop properly, use the kill command above
- Consider using different ports for multiple development instances

## Files Affected
- None (terminal/process management only)

## Date
January 27, 2025

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED**
