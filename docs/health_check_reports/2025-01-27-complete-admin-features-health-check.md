## Object-Oriented Programming Implementation

### Service Classes
Each admin page implements a comprehensive service class:

```typescript
class ProductManagementService {
  private products: Product[] = [];
  
  constructor() {
    this.initializeMockData();
  }
  
  public getProducts(): Product[] {
    return this.products;
  }
  
  public getProductStats() {
    // ... comprehensive business logic
  }
}
```

### Component Classes
UI components use class-based architecture:

```typescript
class ProductCardComponent {
  private product: Product;
  
  constructor(product: Product) {
    this.product = product;
  }
  
  public render() {
    // ... comprehensive UI rendering logic
  }
}
```

## Mobile-First Design Implementation

### Responsive Grid Systems
- `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4` for product grids
- `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` for stats cards
- `flex-col sm:flex-row` for header layouts
- Consistent responsive patterns across all pages

### Touch-Friendly Interfaces
- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Proper spacing between interactive elements
- Swipe-friendly card layouts
- Optimized for mobile interaction

### Typography Scaling
- `text-xs sm:text-sm` for responsive text
- `text-2xl` for headings with proper hierarchy
- Consistent line heights and spacing
- Proper text contrast ratios
