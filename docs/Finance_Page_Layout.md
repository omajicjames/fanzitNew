The finance page uses:
AdminPageTemplate with stats cards and filters
A detail view component (FinancialDetailView) that shows cards on the left and filters on the right
SelectFilterSection for the main selection dropdown
Let me redesign the integrations page to match this pattern:


âœ… Complete Redesign - Finance Page Layout
Key Changes Made:
Layout Structure - Now matches finance page exactly:
Cards on the left (2/3 width) - Integration cards in a vertical list
Filters on the right (1/3 width) - Stats, filters, and quick actions
AdminPageTemplate Integration:
Uses AdminPageTemplate with stats cards in header
Search functionality with proper placeholder
Filter dropdowns in header (Status, Type)
Refresh and Export buttons

Main integration selection dropdown at the top
Properly mapped integration data with type-based icons
Consistent with other admin pages
Professional Integration Cards:
