# Announcements Tab Integration Complete

## Issue Resolution: Module Import Errors and Tab Integration

The user reported module import errors (`Can't resolve '@/components/ui/card'`) and requested that the announcements management be integrated into the admin dashboard with proper tab navigation.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Import Path Issues
- **Problem**: Using `@/` import paths instead of `@src/` paths
- **Solution**: Updated all import statements to use the correct `@src/` prefix
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `/app/(protected)/admin/communications/(tabs)/announcements/page.tsx`
  - All UI component imports now use `@src/components/ui/...`

### 2. Tab Integration Request
- **Problem**: User wanted announcements to be in the admin dashboard with tabs
- **Solution**: Created a comprehensive tab-based communications section
- **Implementation**: Moved announcements under `/admin/communications/(tabs)/announcements/`

## New File Structure

```
app/(protected)/admin/communications/
├── page.tsx                                    # Redirects to announcements
