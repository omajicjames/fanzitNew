# Memory Entry: AnnouncementStack Component Relocation

**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** Move AnnouncementStack from user profile to admin page  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. `/app/(protected)/creator/profile/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed AnnouncementStack component and import
2. `/app/(public)/page.tsx` - Added AnnouncementStack component to right column

### Key Changes:
- **Removed from User Profile:** Eliminated AnnouncementStack from user profile right column
- **Added to Admin Page:** Integrated AnnouncementStack into admin page right column
- **Layout Preservation:** Maintained three-column shell structure on both pages
- **Clean Integration:** Added proper padding and comments for admin page
- **Import Cleanup:** Removed unused AnnouncementStack import from profile page

## Root Cause
User realized the AnnouncementStack widget should be on the admin page for administrative functionality rather than on user profile pages where it was initially implemented.

## Solution
Systematic relocation of the AnnouncementStack component:
1. **Clean Removal:** Removed component and import from user profile page
2. **Proper Integration:** Added component to admin page with appropriate styling
3. **Layout Maintenance:** Preserved existing three-column layout structure
4. **Comment Updates:** Updated documentation to reflect new component location

## Technical Implementation

### User Profile Page Changes
- Removed `import AnnouncementStack from "@src/features/right-rail/AnnouncementStack"`
- Simplified right column to contain only navigator and messaging panel
- Maintained existing layout structure and spacing
- Updated comments to reflect current functionality

### Admin Page Changes
- Added `import AnnouncementStack from "@src/features/right-rail/AnnouncementStack"`
- Replaced blank right column div with AnnouncementStack component
- Added proper padding (`p-4`) for consistent spacing
- Updated layout comments to reflect AnnouncementStack integration

## Key Learning
When relocating components between pages:
- Ensure complete removal from source location (imports, components, comments)
- Proper integration at destination with appropriate styling
- Maintain layout consistency and responsive design
- Update documentation and comments to reflect changes
- Test both source and destination pages for functionality

## Technical Benefits

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Clean component encapsulation maintained during relocation
- Proper separation of user and admin interface concerns
- Reusable component successfully moved without modification
- Type-safe integration with existing layout system

### Mobile-First Design

- Consistent padding and spacing maintained
- Touch-optimized interactions preserved
- Layout integrity maintained across devices

### Architecture Improvements
- Better logical organization of admin functionality
