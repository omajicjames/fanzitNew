# AnnouncementStack Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new AnnouncementStack component system with admin management capabilities, resolving the previous double-line styling issues and providing a comprehensive announcement management solution.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Components Created

#### AnnouncementStack Component
- **Location**: `/src/features/right-rail/AnnouncementStack.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main widget for displaying rotating announcements with admin controls
- **Key Features**:
  - Rotating announcement cards with smooth animations
  - Admin controls (create, edit, delete) when `isAdmin={true}`
  - Progress indicators for multiple announcements
  - Auto-advance with pause on hover
  - Manual navigation controls
  - Proper styling with single border ownership (fixes double-line issue)

#### AnnouncementModal Component
- **Location**: `/src/features/right-rail/AnnouncementModal.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Modal form for creating and editing announcements
- **Key Features**:
  - Form validation with real-time error feedback
  - Character count indicators
  - URL validation (supports relative and absolute URLs)
  - Announcement type selection (info, warning, success, promo)
  - Active/inactive toggle
  - Responsive design with proper accessibility

### 2. TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
interface Announcement {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  link: string;
  type: 'info' | 'warning' | 'success' | 'promo';
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface AnnouncementStackProps {
  className?: string;
  autoAdvanceInterval?: number;
  isAdmin?: boolean;
  onCreateAnnouncement?: () => void;
  onEditAnnouncement?: (announcement: Announcement) => void;
  onDeleteAnnouncement?: (id: string) => void;
}
```

### 3. Styling Fixes Applied

#### Single Border Ownership
- Applied `border border-brand/35` only to the main container
- Removed conflicting border styles from child elements
- Used `no-underline` class on Link components to prevent default underlines

#### Visual Enhancements
- Gradient overlays with `before:` pseudo-elements
- Consistent shadow system
- Proper focus states for accessibility
- Icon mapping for different announcement types

### 4. Integration Points

#### Admin Page Integration
- **File**: `/app/(public)/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added imports for AnnouncementStack and AnnouncementModal
  - Implemented modal state management
  - Added event handlers for CRUD operations
  - Replaced empty rightColumn with functional AnnouncementStack
  - Set `isAdmin={true}` to enable admin controls

### 5. Business Logic

#### AnnouncementController Class
- Encapsulates announcement management logic
- Provides methods for CRUD operations
- Handles navigation between announcements
- Manages default announcement data

#### Default Announcements

- Monetization features update
- Premium trial promotion

### 6. User Experience Features
